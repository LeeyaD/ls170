# The Internet
* What is a network?
When 2 or more devices are connected and able to communicate, i.e. share data.

* What is a protocol?
Protocols are systems of rules.

* What are network protocols?
Systems of rules that control the transmission of data over a network.

* What is the internet?
A network of networks. It's made up of a *network infrastructure* (i.e. devices, routers, switches, cables, etc.) and *protocols* that support it. It's the interaction of those protocols via the infrastructure that facilitates the communication of networked applications.

* In the context of network protocols, what is *encapsulation*?
When data is being hid from one layer by encapsulating it in the PDU, **Protocol Data Unit**, of the layer below it.

* What are 2 main characteristics of a physical network?
Latency and bandwidth.

* What is *latency*?
A measure of delay, it's the time it takes for data to get from one point in a network to another point in a network. There's actually 4 types of delays that contirbute to the overall latency of a network.

* What is *bandwidth*?
A measure of capacity, it's the amount of data that can be sent in a particular period of time. Here's it's usually a millisecond (ms.)

* What are well-known models that demonstrate network communication?
The OSI and TCP/IP models breakdown network communication into layers where protocols are grouped by what they address. 

The OSI model groups protocols by the function they provide and has 7 layers (Physical > Data Link > Network > Transport > ? > ? > Application). 

The TCP/IP (IP Suite) model groups protocols by the scope of communication within the layer and has 4 layers (Link > Internet > Transport > Application).

* What are PDUs and why are they so important?
They're blocks of code being transmitted over a network and consist of a header, a data payload and sometimes a tail or footer. 

The header & footer contains protocol-specific metadata about the PDU and the data payload contains the data being transferred over the network using a specific protocol at a particular network layer. An Ethernet PDU is called a frame, an IP PDU is called a 'packet' and a TCP or UDP PDU is called a 'segment' or 'datagram',respectively.
