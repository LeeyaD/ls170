# The Internet
A network of networks that enable communication of various networked applications--the interaction of multiple different protocols (systems of rules).

**Network**
Devices connetected in such a way that they can communicate or exchange data.

### (Wireless)LAN [Local Area Network]
Multiple computers/devices connected (wirelessly or w/ network cables), to a network bridging device (i.e. a switch or hub). **The scope of communication is limited to devices that are connected to this switch/hub which has geographical limitations.

### Routers
Network devices that allow communication between networks by routing network traffic to other networks. Act as a gateway into & out of a network. Between each sub-network are systems of routers that direct the network traffic.
