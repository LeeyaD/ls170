# The Internet
### Learn that IP enables communication between devices
Make sure to form a clear mental model of what The Internet Protocol (IP) does as it's a key part of the functionality of the internet.

## Summary
* Different types of protocol are concerned with different aspects of network communication. It can be useful to think of these different protocols as operating at particular 'layers' of the network.

* *Encapsulation* is a means by which protocols at different network layers can work together.

* Encapsulation is implemented through the use of *Protocol Data Units* (PDUs). The PDU of a protocol at one layer, becomes the data payload of the PDU of a protocol at a lower layer.

* The *physical network* is the tangible infrastructure that transmits the electrical signals, light, and radio waves which carry network communications.

* *Ethernet* is a set of standards and protocols that enables *communication between devices on a local network*.

* Ethernet uses *MAC addressing* to identify devices connected to the local network.

* The *Internet Protocol* (IP) is the predominant protocol used for *inter-network communication*.

* There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

* The *Internet Protocol* uses a system of addressing (IP Addressing) to *direct data between one device and another across networks*.
