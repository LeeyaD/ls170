Mental model of data moving through the layers and over the network: Like a present being wrapped up in order to be shipped and then unwrapped by the received.

**Burning thoughts & Qs**
1. Still a little fuzzy on how the Ethernet protocol moves data over the physical network. It's just the metadata in the header right? like MAC addressing piggy-backs off of the frames, right?

2. In connection-oriented communication, when a new socket object is created that contains both the source and destinateion IP addresses & port #s, what happens to the first socket object that just contains the source IP & port #? Is it never used again or deleted? I think when it can no longer be referenced, it "dies"

3. LS defines a *network infrastructure* as "..devices, routers, switches, cables, etc." (Lesson 1: Summary), but I read somewhere the "physical network is comprised of devices that transmit electrical signals, light, and radio waves". Is it okay to include 'routers' & 'switches' in my definition of a network infrastructure AND in how I describe the *physical network*?

4. Are network "hops" only between routers? Or can a hop be from a router to a switch or a switch to the actual host device?
